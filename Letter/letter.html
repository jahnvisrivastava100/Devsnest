           With due respect it is humbly stated that I am the student of 2 <sup>nd</sup> year.I am writing this letter to inform you about Devsnest.
           Devsnest is a mentorship program designed to help students to get their dream job. It evolves as per student's  needs and help in  moulding them into an amazing  developer.
           Their aim is to create a complete ecosystem which could guide and teach students to become a proficient developer in 6 months from scratch.
          <br> <br> The best part about Devsnest is that they offer Live classes,Personalised guidance and project driven curriculum.Their concept of peer learning allows us to know more than we are capable of knowing by ourselves.Their Guest sessions  acts as cherry on cake and are highly informative.
          <br><br> In a nutshell all I want to say is that devsnest is an amazing program and we should motivate students of our campus to take part in it.
           
           <br><br> Anticipating a positive response.
